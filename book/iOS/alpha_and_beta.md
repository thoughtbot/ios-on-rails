# Alpha and Beta Schemes

Distributing a Beta version of your app to testers before submitting to the app store is a vital part of the submittal process for medium to large scale apps. Humon may be a small app now, but we are going to set up a Alpha and Beta configuration and scheme in order to follow with best practices.

Every time you want to distribute a new build to Beta testers, you'll archive it and save it for ad hoc distribution. So, what we're going to do is create a Beta scheme that we'll use every time we archive a Beta version of the app. We'll use the default Humon scheme for archiving the actual production version of the app. The only differences between the new schemes will be the API endpoint (staging or production) we're hitting, the app name on the home screen, and the app's bundle ID.

Setting these manually is perfectly fine as well, but keeping separate configurations for Alpha, Beta, and production ensures that we never forget something important, like switching out the staging endpoint. The following steps will refer to creating the Beta scheme and are exactly the same for creating an Alpha scheme.

### Setting Up the New Schemes

1. **Create the new configuration**

    Select the Humon project and create a new configuration that's a duplicate of release, and call this new configuration Beta.
	
2. **Create the new scheme**

	Create a new scheme that's a duplicate of the main Humon scheme. Call this scheme HumonBeta.

	Set this scheme's run build configuration and archive build configuration to Beta.)

3. **Automate the bundle identifier and display name**

	Under "Info", change the Bundle identifier and the Bundle display name to include `${CONFIGURATION}`. `${CONFIGURATION}` evaluates to the name of the current build configuration.
   
	Now the name of the Beta app will display as HumonBeta and the bundle identifier will be com.thoughtbot.HumonBeta.
	
4. **Use the user-defined setting in a pre-processor macro.**

	![Use the ROOT_URL in a pre-processor macro](images/ios_alpha_and_beta_6.png)
	
	Under "Build Settings", search for preprocessor macros and add `ROOT_URL='@"yourProductionURL"'` to the release and Beta configurations and `ROOT_URL='@"yourStagingURL"'` for debug and Alpha configurations.
	
5. **Build the app using the new scheme.**

	The app's name should display as HumonBeta if everything has been configured correctly. In addition, you can now use `ROOT_URL` instead of a string literal everywhere you want to conditionally use your staging or production base URL.
