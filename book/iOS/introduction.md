# Introduction

The iOS portion of this book will cover creating a new Xcode project, using a
few Cocoapods to help you get started, and making basic API requests to the API
you just created.

If you haven't created a project with Xcode before, images are included to
help you navigate the wilds that are Apple's dev tools. Xcode is an
exciting editor that may take a bit of getting used to, so if you would like a
primer, please visit [Apple's Xcode
Overview.]("https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode_Overview/About_Xcode/about.html")

Rails developers will find that Cocoapods feels quite familiar given that the
dependency manager is written in Ruby and allows you to use iOS libraries,
similar to how you use Ruby gems. A good understanding of object oriented
programming is also required for the iOS portion of this book. Like Rails, iOS
uses the Model-View-Controller design pattern, with the small caveat that most of your
controllers will instead be called ViewControllers.
