# A New Xcode Project

For all iOS apps, the first step is to create a new project in Xcode. 
Create a new "Single View Project" with your own name and identifier. 
Running the project for the first time will yield a white screen.

A useful resource for new Swift projects is GitHub's 
[gitignore template. ](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Swift.gitignore)
Add a gitignore to your new project before creating your first commit.
