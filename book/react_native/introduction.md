# Introduction

The Mobile part of this book will cover creating a React Native project. It uses
TypeScript to make requests to the API you built and display the JSON you
receive.

If you are yet to use [React Native][], we have included a few images to assist
your understanding of the dev tools. React Native combines the best parts of
native development with React. It allows us to create native mobile apps for
Android and iOS using the same codebase.

[TypeScript][] is a typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. It
gives you better tooling at any scale.
