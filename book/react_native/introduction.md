# Introduction

The iOS portion of this book will cover creating an Xcode project, 
using CocoaPods, 
making requests to the API you just created, 
and displaying the JSON you receive.

If you haven't created a project with Xcode before, 
we have included a few images 
to assist your understanding of Apple's dev tools. 
Xcode is an exciting editor that takes a bit of getting used to, 
so if you would like a primer please visit 
[Apple's Xcode Overview.](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode_Overview/index.html)

CocoaPods should feel quite familiar to Ruby developers, 
since it is written in Ruby 
and allows you to use iOS libraries similarly to how you use Ruby gems. 
Like Rails, iOS uses the Model-View-Controller design pattern, 
with the small caveat that most of your controllers 
will instead be called ViewControllers.
