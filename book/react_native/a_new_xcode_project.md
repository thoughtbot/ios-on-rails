# A New Xcode Project

For all iOS apps, the first step is to create a new project in Xcode. 
Create a new "Single View Project" with your own name and identifier. 
Running the project for the first time will yield a white screen.

We want our app to target iOS 8.0 and above. 
Open the Humon project in the file navigator and select the Humon target. 
Under the "General" tab, select 8.0 as the Deployment Target.

A useful resource for new Objective-C projects is GitHub's 
[gitignore template. ](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Objective-C.gitignore)
Add a gitignore to your new project before creating your first commit.
