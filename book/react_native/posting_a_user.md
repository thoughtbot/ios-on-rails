# Posting a User With NSURLSession

Now that we have a singleton `HUMRailsClient`, a configured session property on that object, and a `HUMUserSession` object, we can create instances of `NSURLSessionTask` that will actually make our API request. 

### Declaring a Task for Making Requests

Declare a method in our `HUMRailsClient.h` that creates a POST request to /users.

	- (void)createCurrentUserWithCompletionBlock:
		(void (^)(NSError *error))block;

The type of our parameter for this method is a block, which we declare here with `(void (^)(NSError *error))`. Declaring a block as our parameter type is similar to how we declare other parameter types like `(NSString *)`, where the word following the type is the name of the parameter. This block has a return type of `void` and one argument of type `NSError` so we can check if the POST completed with an error.

It makes sense to typedef a new name for our completion block so we can refer to it more easily, especially if we plan on using this block type again. Using typedef allows us to define a new name for an existing type, which in this case will be the new name `HUMRailsClientErrorCompletionBlock` for the block type `(void (^)(NSError *error))`. Place this typedef above the interface in HUMRailsClient.h:

	typedef void(^HUMRailsClientErrorCompletionBlock)(NSError *error);
	
The block that we typedef is the same as the block we previously declared, so now we can declare the method `-createCurrentUserWithCompletionBlock:` as so:

	- (void)createCurrentUserWithCompletionBlock:
		(HUMRailsClientErrorCompletionBlock)block;

The [Apple Developer Library](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/cocoa/Conceptual/Blocks/Articles/bxDeclaringCreating.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007502-CH4-SW1) has an in-depth section on declaring blocks in Objective C, for those interested. This [cheat sheet](http://goshdarnblocksyntax.com) of different block syntaxes may also be of help, as they do vary slightly.

### Creating a Task for Making Requests

Now that we have declared `-createCurrentUserWithCompletionBlock:` and typedef-ed its completion block, we can define the method.

	// HUMRailsClient.m
	
	- (void)createCurrentUserWithCompletionBlock:
		(HUMRailsClientCompletionBlock)block
	{
    	// Create a request for the POST to /users
    	NSString *urlString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@users", HUMRootURL];
    	NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:urlString];
    	NSMutableURLRequest *request = [[NSMutableURLRequest alloc] initWithURL:url];
    	[request setHTTPMethod:@"POST"];
    	
    	// Create a task to encapsulate your request and a completion block
    	NSURLSessionTask *task = [self.session dataTaskWithRequest:request
                                             	completionHandler:
        	^void (NSData *data, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
        
        	// See 'Responding to Completion of the Task'
        
    	}];
    	
    	[task resume];
	}
	
First, we instantiate a `url` for our request, which in this case is our ROOT_URL (which we set up with a user-defined macro) with `@"users"` appended to it. Then we can instantiate a `request` using this URL and set the request method to POST.

Now that we have a `request`, we can create a task for our `self.session` that will execute the request. The method `-dataTaskWithRequest:completionHandler:` takes two arguments: the `request` that we created and a block that will be run when the request is complete.

The block we pass into the method must be of a type defined by `-dataTaskWithRequest:completionHandler:`, so we pass in a block of the appropriate type as an argument with this syntax:

	^void (NSData *data, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) { 
		// code to execute
	}

Where the block's return type is `void` and the block's parameters are `data`, `response`, and `error`. We don't have to explicitly declare the void return type, since it can be inferred, which means we could instead use the syntax:

	^(NSData *data, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) { 
		// code to execute
	}

Finally, we fire off the task by calling the method resume on the task object you just created. 

### Responding to the Completion of the Task

Once the task has completed, the block we just defined will be invoked with the relevant `data`, `response`, and `error` as arguments. Replace the comment in the completion block with the following:

	// HUMRailsClient.m
	
    if (!error) {
    	// Set the user session properties using the response
        NSDictionary *responseDictionary = [NSJSONSerialization
                                            JSONObjectWithData:data
                                            options:kNilOptions
                                            error:nil];
        [HUMUserSession setUserToken:responseDictionary[@"auth_token"]];
        [HUMUserSession setUserID:responseDictionary[@"id"]];
        
        // Create a new configuration with new token
        NSURLSessionConfiguration *newConfiguration =
            self.session.configuration;
        [newConfiguration setHTTPAdditionalHeaders:
            @{
                @"Accept" : @"application/json",
                @"Content-Type" : @"application/json",
                @"tb-auth-token" : responseDictionary[@"auth_token"]
            }];
        [self.session finishTasksAndInvalidate];
        self.session = [NSURLSession sessionWithConfiguration:
                        newConfiguration];
    }
    
    // Execute the completion block regardless of the error
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
        block(error);
    });

If there is no error, we can create a dictionary using the response data from the task. This dictionary will contain an `auth_token` and an `id` for a user. We can save these using the class methods we created on `HUMUserSession`.

Now that we have an `auth_token` that is associated with a user in the database, we will use it to sign our requests. Create a `newConfiguration` that is a copy of the old configuration, place the `auth_token` in the `newConfiguration`'s header, and set `self.session` to a new session that uses the `newConfiguration`.

Regardless of whether or not there's an error, we want to execute the completion block we passed into the method `-createCurrentUserWithCompletionBlock:`. Since we will be updating the UI in this completion block, we have to force the completion block to execute on the main thread using `dispatch_async`. Alternatively, you could use `NSOperationQueue` to execute the block on the main thread, but since we are just sending off a block I chose to use `dispatch_async`.

### Setting the Headers Conditionally

Now that we have a POST to the users endpoint method and we store the token recieved from this method, we can conditionally set our session's headers depending on whether we have a stored auth token.

Currently, our custom init method sets a `tb-app-secret` in our headers every time it initializes. This is the correct header for a POST request to /users, but we need different headers for all our other requests.

In the custom init method of our `HUMRailsClient`, change the `headers` variable to a ternary.

	// HUMRailsClient.m
	
    NSDictionary *headers = [HUMUserSession userIsLoggedIn] ?
        @{
          @"Accept" : @"application/json",
          @"Content-Type" : @"application/json",
          @"tb-auth-token" : [HUMUserSession userToken]
          } :
        @{
          @"Accept" : @"application/json",
          @"Content-Type" : @"application/json",
          @"tb-app-secret" : HUMAppSecret
          };
          
This ternary depends on the class methods `+userIsLoggedIn` and `+userToken` that we defined on `HUMUserSession`, so remember to `#import "HUMUserSession.h"` at the top of the file. It sets the headers to include the saved `+[HUMUserSession userToken]` if we are logged in. 

If we aren't logged in, we need to send the app secret so the backend will accept our POST request to create a new user.
